This project was bootstrapped with [Create Argos App](https://github.com/owennicol/create-argos-app).

Check out [Next.js repo](https://github.com/zeit/next.js) for the most up-to-date info.

## Things to do:

- Take this out of Owen's personal github repo
- Use SASS instead of css-in-js
- CLI improvements
  - Many...
- Proper documentation

## Folder Structure

After creating an app, it should look something like:

```
.
├── README.md
├── components
│   ├── head.js
│   └── nav.js
├── next.config.js
├── node_modules
│   ├── [...]
├── package.json
├── pages
│   └── index.js
├── static
│   └── favicon.ico
└── yarn.lock
```

Routing in Next.js is based on the file system, so `./pages/index.js` maps to the `/` route and
`./pages/about.js` would map to `/about`.

The `./static` directory maps to `/static` in the `next` server, so you can put all your
other static resources like images or compiled CSS in there.

Out of the box, we get:

- Automatic transpilation and bundling (with webpack and babel)
- Hot code reloading
- Server rendering and indexing of `./pages`
- Static file serving. `./static/` is mapped to `/static/`

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any errors in the console.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `.next` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

### `yarn run`

Starts the application in production mode.
The application should be compiled with \`next build\` first.

See the section in Next docs about [deployment](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/wiki/Deployment) for more information.

## Using CSS

[`styled-jsx`](https://github.com/zeit/styled-jsx) is bundled with next to provide support for isolated scoped CSS. The aim is to support "shadow CSS" resembling of Web Components, which unfortunately [do not support server-rendering and are JS-only](https://github.com/w3c/webcomponents/issues/71).

```jsx
export default () => (
  <div>
    Hello world
    <p>scoped!</p>
    <style jsx>{`
      p {
        color: blue;
      }
      div {
        background: red;
      }
      @media (max-width: 600px) {
        div {
          background: blue;
        }
      }
    `}</style>
  </div>
)
```

Read more about [Next's CSS features](https://github.com/zeit/next.js#css).

## Adding Components

We recommend keeping React components in `./components` and they should look like:

### `./components/simple.js`

```jsx
const Simple = () => <div>Simple Component</div>

export default Simple // don't forget to export default!
```

### `./components/complex.js`

```jsx
import { Component } from 'react'

class Complex extends Component {
  state = {
    text: 'World'
  }

  render() {
    const { text } = this.state
    return <div>Hello {text}</div>
  }
}

export default Complex // don't forget to export default!
```

## Fetching Data

You can fetch data in `pages` components using `getInitialProps` like this:

### `./pages/stars.js`

```jsx
const Page = props => <div>Next stars: {props.stars}</div>

Page.getInitialProps = async ({ req }) => {
  const res = await fetch('https://api.github.com/repos/zeit/next.js')
  const json = await res.json()
  const stars = json.stargazers_count
  return { stars }
}

export default Page
```

For the initial page load, `getInitialProps` will execute on the server only. `getInitialProps` will only be executed on the client when navigating to a different route via the `Link` component or using the routing APIs.

_Note: `getInitialProps` can **not** be used in children components. Only in `pages`._

## Custom Server

Want to start a new app with a custom server? Run `create-next-app --example customer-server custom-app`

Typically you start your next server with `next start`. It's possible, however, to start a server 100% programmatically in order to customize routes, use route patterns, etc

This example makes `/a` resolve to `./pages/b`, and `/b` resolve to `./pages/a`:

```jsx
const { createServer } = require('http')
const { parse } = require('url')
const next = require('next')

const dev = process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production'
const app = next({ dev })
const handle = app.getRequestHandler()

app.prepare().then(() => {
  createServer((req, res) => {
    // Be sure to pass `true` as the second argument to `url.parse`.
    // This tells it to parse the query portion of the URL.
    const parsedUrl = parse(req.url, true)
    const { pathname, query } = parsedUrl

    if (pathname === '/a') {
      app.render(req, res, '/b', query)
    } else if (pathname === '/b') {
      app.render(req, res, '/a', query)
    } else {
      handle(req, res, parsedUrl)
    }
  }).listen(3000, err => {
    if (err) throw err
    console.log('> Ready on http://localhost:3000')
  })
})
```

Then, change your `run` script to `NODE_ENV=production node server.js`.
